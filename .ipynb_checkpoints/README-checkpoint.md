## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to create a supervised machine learning model that can predict if a loan is safe (class 0) or risky (class 1). I chose logistic regression, a method used to make decisions between two options. The data used for this model includes details like loan amount, interest rate, borrowerâ€™s income, debt, and more. The aim was to predict whether a loan will be healthy (0) or high-risk (1). The dataset contains 77,500 rows of information in a CSV file.

Steps in the Process:

* The data has splited into labels (loan status: healthy or risky) and features (the other details about the loan).
* The data was then divided into training and testing sets.
* We created a Logistic Regression model, which helps in predicting two outcomes: healthy or risky.
* The model was trained using the training data.
* We used the test data to make predictions.
* Finally, we evaluated how well the model performed using accuracy, precision, and recall scores.


## Results
Model Performance:

Accuracy: The model is 99% accurate, meaning it correctly predicts 99% of the loans.

Precision (correct predictions):

Healthy Loan (Class 0): 1.00 (100% correct)
High-Risk Loan (Class 1): 0.85 (85% correct)

Recall (capturing actual cases):

Healthy Loan (Class 0): 0.99 (99% correct)
High-Risk Loan (Class 1): 0.91 (91% correct)


## Summary

The logistic regression model is excellent at predicting healthy loans (class 0), with perfect precision (1.00) and nearly perfect recall (0.99). For risky loans (class 1), it does a good job too, with a precision of 0.85 and recall of 0.91.

However, the model struggles a bit more with risky loans because there are fewer examples of them in the data (only 619 high-risk loans compared to 18,765 healthy ones). Adding more high-risk loans to the dataset could help improve the model's ability to predict them.

Since preventing risky loans is more important than just predicting healthy ones (because a defaulted loan can cause more loss), this model does a good job overall, with an accuracy of 99%.
